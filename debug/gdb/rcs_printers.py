# GDB pretty printers for Rcs structs.
# Allows to view MatNd values without extra effort.
# This has been derived from Eigen's pretty printers.

# To use it:
#
# * Create a directory and put the file as well as an empty __init__.py in 
#   that directory.
# * Create a ~/.gdbinit file, that contains the following:
#      python
#      import sys
#      sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/rcs/printer/directory')
#      from rcs_printers import register_rcs_printers
#      register_rcs_printers (None)
#      end

import gdb
