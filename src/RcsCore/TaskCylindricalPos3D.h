 * \brief This tasks allows to set a 3D position (cylindrical coordinates) of
 *        an effector. The position can also be relative to another body and
 *        reference frame. Internally, the cylinder coordinates are projected
 *        on position coordinates. This means that the componets on velocity
 *        level are cartesian coordinates. It implies that decomposing the
 *        task elements into cylinder coordinate components, for instance when
 *        using hybrid position-force control, is not possible. For this case,
 *        please use the class TaskCylindrical3D.
