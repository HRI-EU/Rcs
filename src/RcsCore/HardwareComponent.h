/*! \ingroup RcsMotionControlLayer
 *  \brief Base class for hardware components
 *
 *         This base class is a generic interface between hardware and control
 *         layers. Derived classes have to implement a updateGraph() method
 *         that reads out the sensory information and writes it into the graph.
 *
 *         The updateGraph() method doesn't need to compute the forward
 *         kinematics, that is done in the class MotionControlLayer that
 *         organizes a vector of HardwareComponents.
 *
 *         The setCommand() method gets three input arrays that are of
 *         the same dimensionality as the the graph. If a
 *         HardwareComponent is driving a robot, the corresponding
 *         entries of the q, qp and / or T vector are to be read out
 *         at the corresponding indices, and the values to be sent to
 *         the motors / joints. If a HardwareComponent does not drive
 *         hardware with actuators, this methods implementation is
 *         just empty.
 *
 *         Usually HardwareComponents have one or several threads that
 *         talk to some sensor / robot. If you want to make a
 *         HardwareComponent responsible to periodically call the
 *         MotionControlLayers updateControl() routine, this can be
 *         done with the registerCallback() function. The component
 *         then simply needs to call callControlLayerCallbackIfConnected()
 *         from the thread. A number of code example can be found in
 *         different derived classes (e.g. LwaComponent).
