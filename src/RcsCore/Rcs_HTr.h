 * \defgroup RcsHTrFunctions HTr: Transformation functions
 *
 *         HTr stands for homogeneous transform. This data structure consists of
 *         a translation vector (org means origin), and a rotation matrix (rot).
 *         The rotation is applied after the translation.
 *
 *         The convention in Rcs is the following: Rotation matrices are assumed
 *         to be in row-major form. It means that A_21 denotes a rotation of
 *         frame 1 into frame 2. It also means that the rows of matrix A_21
 *         correspond to the unit vectors of frame 2, represented in frame 1.
