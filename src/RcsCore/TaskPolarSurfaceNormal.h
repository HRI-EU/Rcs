 * \brief This tasks allows to set a 2D orientation (Polar angles) of an
 *        effector. The orientation can also be relative to another body and
 *        reference frame. The polar axis is taken from the effector body. By
 *        default, it is the z-axis. It can be specified with the xml tag
 *        - axisDirection="X"
 *        - axisDirection="Y"
 *        - axisDirection="Z"
 *        to select which axis direction from the effector body is used.
 *
 *        To avoid jumps in the feedback, the velocities and accelerations are
 *        calculated in the effector's angular velocity (with respect to the
 *        reference body, which is the world rfame if none is given).
