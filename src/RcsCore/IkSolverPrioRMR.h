   *                         space dimension (including constrained dofs).
   *  \param[out] dq2        Joint space displacement of the second
   *                         priority task space. The dimension is

   *  \param[out] dq_ns      Joint space displacement of the null space.
   *                         The  dimension is dof x 1, where dof is
   *                         the full configuration space dimension
   *                         (including constrained dofs).

   *                         of the sum of all task dimension. The vector

   *                         nJ x 1, or of 1 x nJ, where nJ is the number
   *                         of unconstrained dofs.

   *                         equal zero will be ignored. If activation is
   *                         NULL, all tasks will be considered as active.
   *                         The vector must be of dimension numTasks x 1.
   *  \param[in]  lambda     Regularization factor for the pseudo-inverse.
   *  \return true for success, false if one of the IK projections
   *          became singular (determinant <=0). In this case, all
   *          return arrays are set to 0.
