/*! \ingroup RcsTask
 *  \brief This tasks allows to set a 3D position (XYZ) of an effector. The
 *         position can also be relative to another body and reference frame.
 *
 *  The task vector is computed as:
 *
 *  1. If a reference body does not exist:
 *
 *     A) No reference frame exist:
 *       I_r = I_r_effector
 *
 *     B) A reference frame and no reference body exist:
 *       refFrame_r = A_refFrame-I * I_r_effector
 *
 *  2. If a reference body exists:
 *
 *     A) No reference frame exists, or reference frame is equal to reference
 *        body: subtract its origin and rotate the result into the reference
 *        bodies's basis:
 *        refBdy_r = A_refBdy-I * (I_r - I_r_refBdy)
 *
 *     B) A reference frame that is different to the reference body exists:
 *        subtract its origin and rotate the result into the reference frame's
 *        basis:
 *        refFrame_r = A_refFrame-I * (I_r - I_r_refBdy)
 *
 *  The following xml tags are parsed in the xml constructor:
 *  - controlVariable: must be "XYZ"
 *  - effector="Name of effector RcsBody"
 *  - refBdy="Name of reference RcsBody"
 *  - refFrame="Name of reference frame RcsBody"
 *  - guiMin: three values for lower bounds slider values (default: -2.5)
 *  - guiMax: three values for lower bounds slider values (default: +2.5)
 *  - name: The task name will be displayed in Gui (unless it is the default
 *          name "Unnamed task")
 *
 *  Example:
 *  \code
 *    <Task name="Pos" controlVariable="XYZ" effector="Hand" active="true" />
 *  \endcode
