 *  Description: Slider class for GUI elements. <br>
 *
 *  Values lowerBound and upperBound are scaled with the given scaleFactor.
 *  The scale factor is meant to scale the range to human readable units, so
 *  that the GUI displays angles in degrees and translations in mm. The
 *  slider return value however returns the values WITHOUT the scale factor,
 *  since we never use degrees or mm inside our computation.
 *  The command values should also be in SI units. The scaling to human
 *  readable units is done within this class.
