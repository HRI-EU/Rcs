 *         can be toggled. A osg::PositionAttitudeTransform child node allows
 *         to set transforma of any added child geometry. Further, it is
 *         possible to link the node to a pointer with transform coordinates
 *         originating from somewhere else. The makeDynamic calls add an
 *         event callback that is called during the viewer's step method.
